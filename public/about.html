<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a passionate and dedicated individual with a diverse background in health and wellness, a budding career in chiropractic care, and a growing love for coding. My journey has been anything but ordinary—balancing hands-on experience as a sports massage therapist, part-time university studies for a master’s in chiropractic, and the challenge of running my own business. Through it all, I’ve discovered a knack for problem-solving, creativity, and an insatiable curiosity for learning new skills.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve embarked on an exciting journey into the world of web development and programming as a self-taught junior coder. Diving into coding has been a refreshing change of pace—merging my methodical approach to health sciences with the logic and creativity of software development. Whether it’s building snazzy websites or tinkering with code to solve problems, I’m constantly learning and pushing my boundaries.</p>
  
<p>Beyond my professional life, I’m someone who thrives on staying active and healthy. Strength training, CrossFit, and exploring how the body works are more than hobbies—they’re passions that inspire much of what I do. With my unique combination of skills and interests, I’m driven by a simple goal: to help others improve their lives, whether that’s through better movement, relaxation, or creating a digital experience that makes a difference.</p>
  
<p>This site is a glimpse into my world—a blend of wellness, creativity, and growth. I’m excited to share my journey with you and hope it inspires you to explore your own passions. Let’s connect, create, and thrive together!</p>
